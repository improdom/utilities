Patrudu has been a highly reliable and collaborative member of the Aggregation Team in Market Risk, and his positive attitude has strengthened our team dynamics. To further support his growth and contributions, he could benefit from actively seeking opportunities to share his expertise in the Message Broker and Power BI Orchestration services across the team. Engaging more frequently in technical discussions, perhaps by leading brief knowledge-sharing sessions or proposing best practices, could help him solidify his role as a go-to resource within the team.

Moreover, as he continues to demonstrate his strong ownership of tasks, exploring more proactive involvement in project planning phases could allow him to offer valuable insights early in the process, helping anticipate potential challenges and optimizing project execution.
