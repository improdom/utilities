Throughout this year, I have exemplified UBS behaviors in various ways, especially in collaboration, innovation, and accountability.

Collaboration: I have consistently collaborated across teams, particularly with the Databricks team, to build a data model that aligns with Power BI’s requirements. This partnership ensured our data source was optimized for performance, supporting our goals for fast data refreshes and reliable query performance. Moving forward, I plan to foster even deeper cross-functional relationships by proactively seeking feedback and knowledge-sharing sessions, which will help to align objectives and facilitate smoother project execution.

Innovation: I’ve taken an innovative approach to enhance our Power BI model’s efficiency and user experience. For example, I developed a suite of quality assurance tools, including the MRV reconciliation service and the CDM Stress Tool, to improve data integrity and performance. Additionally, I am currently working on an AI-powered application to analyze usage logs, which will provide insights for continuous model optimization. To further demonstrate innovation, I intend to explore additional AI applications for predictive analytics and performance forecasting, positioning our team at the forefront of technology in data management.

Accountability: I hold myself accountable for the quality and effectiveness of my work. By optimizing our Power BI composite model and creating tools to improve data processing, I took responsibility for delivering measurable improvements in system performance. I also prioritize transparency in my progress, ensuring that stakeholders are updated on achievements and challenges. To strengthen accountability, I aim to enhance my project documentation and reporting practices, providing clearer, data-driven insights into the impact of my initiatives.

By building on these strengths, I plan to continue demonstrating UBS behaviors through more strategic collaborations, innovative solutions, and a strong commitment to accountability. These efforts will support our organization’s objectives and reinforce our team’s value within the business.
