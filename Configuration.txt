This year, my primary focus was on enhancing the design of the aggregation platform and bringing it to fruition by leading the team in the technical implementation. My contributions played a significant role in the following areas:

Optimizing Service Efficiency and Resilience: I enhanced the efficiency and resilience of critical services, such as the Message Broker and Power BI, to ensure smooth and reliable data processing workflows.

Advancing Power BI Composite Models: I optimized our Power BI Composite model using advanced techniques, including aggregation awareness and hybrid tables, to maximize resource efficiency in areas like memory and CPU utilization. This approach has greatly improved our query performance.

Collaborating with Databricks for Optimized Data Models: I worked closely with the Databricks team to build a data model tailored to Power BIâ€™s Common Data Model (CDM) requirements. This collaboration resulted in an optimized data source that supports fast data refreshes and improved query performance, aligning with Power BI's data handling standards.

Developing Quality Assurance Tools: I created a suite of tools aimed at supporting robust system quality assurance, such as:

The MRV reconciliation service for validating data, comparing complex calculations, and identifying anomalies.
The CDM Stress Tool, a benchmarking and performance analytics tool used by the team to detect bottlenecks in query execution, enhancing the responsiveness of our models.
