Hi Stuart,

Here are the proposed steps for the CI/CD process:

CI Process:

Create a new branch with a name starting with "FEATURE-...".
The TMDL code will be stored in the "Arisk Sensitivities" folder within the repository's root. Any changes will be saved in this same folder.
Once a change is ready, it should be pushed to GitLab and merged into the DEVELOPMENT or MASTER branch. A peer developer should review and approve it.
The pipeline will automatically trigger, and the TMDL code will be packaged in a Docker container.
CD Process:

From the Docker pipeline, retrieve the build version number from the Build stage.
Update the version in the aggregation Helm project within the values.yaml file.
Merge the change into the development branch.
Deploy to the selected environment using the UBSDeploy artifact.
I will schedule a meeting to review the CD deployment part, as itâ€™s slightly more complex due to the AKS integration.

Thanks,
Julio Diaz
