o increase my impact, I am focusing on expanding my skill set in AI and machine learning, specifically as applied to data analytics and model optimization. My goal is to develop an AI-powered application that analyzes user logs generated from Power BI model interactions. This application will identify patterns in model usage, highlight frequently used dimensions and attributes, and detect areas for potential enhancement. By automatically prioritizing attributes and suggesting calculation improvements, this tool will provide data-driven insights to optimize the model continuously. This initiative will not only improve the user experience but also increase model efficiency and performance, aligning with our overall strategic goals.

Additionally, I aim to enhance my leadership skills by actively mentoring junior team members, sharing best practices in advanced modeling techniques, and fostering collaboration across teams, especially with Databricks and Power BI specialists. This will allow me to contribute more broadly and support team growth, further amplifying our collective impact.
