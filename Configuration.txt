Dear [Colleague's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to address the errors we’ve encountered in our semantic model, I understand that a ticket was opened with Microsoft to investigate these issues further. Could you please share any information or updates obtained from the ticket?

Specifically, I’d like to review any findings, recommendations, or next steps they’ve provided so we can incorporate them into our analysis and resolution plan. If there are any related files or reports, kindly include those as well.

Let me know if there’s anything you need from me to assist with this.

Thank you for your help!
