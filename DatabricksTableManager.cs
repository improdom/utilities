Team,

We see the need for a centralized place to aggregate logs from all CubIQ components. This would improve troubleshooting, give us unified visibility, and enable real-time monitoring through a single dashboard.

Since Marvel handles reporting and monitoring surfaces, it may make sense to integrate this capability there. Does Marvel already have an infrastructure we could leverage, or would this require a new extension?

Thanks,
Julio
