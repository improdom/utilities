I consistently demonstrated commitment to UBS risk and compliance expectations by completing all mandatory trainings ahead of deadline and achieving maximum assessment scores. I participated in governance meetings and compliance affirmations as required and ensured my work followed internal controls, documentation standards, and escalation guidelines. Throughout the year, I maintained full adherence to regulatory and audit expectations and supported transparency by raising risks, issues, and dependencies proactively when appropriate. These actions contributed to maintaining a controlled delivery environment, supporting audit readiness, and reinforcing the firm’s risk culture.
