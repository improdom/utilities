The code for the application that automates the Power BI semantic model deployment has now been pushed to the GitLab repository. It includes the complete deployment workflow: preparing the TMDL model, applying the required configuration through environment variables, and publishing the model using UBS Deploy as part of the GitLab pipeline.

The process runs end-to-end through CI/CD, ensuring consistent and repeatable deployments without manual steps. This brings our semantic-model deployment fully in line with CubIQ’s engineering standards.
