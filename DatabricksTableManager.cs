Hi Siva, Suresh, and Pankaj,

Just to clarify my earlier note: I wasn’t referring to the traditional component-level logging frameworks—we can and should continue using those within each microservice.

What I meant is the centralized logging service that uses Application Insights as the backend. This is the pattern already adopted by other UBS teams and integrates smoothly with the existing support tooling for alerts, dashboards, and operational monitoring.

My intention is to ensure CubIQ aligns with that enterprise approach so support teams have a consolidated view across components.

Happy to discuss further on the call.

Regards,
Julio
