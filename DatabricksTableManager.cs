Over the year, I maintained regular touchpoints with the team through 1:1s, discussions, and ongoing feedback aligned to objectives and performance expectations. I ensured mandatory people-management responsibilities were completed, including training oversight, compliance attestations, and HR processes within required timelines. I fostered an open environment where concerns, risks, and workload pressures could be raised and appropriately escalated when needed. Throughout the year, I supported team wellbeing, respected flexibility needs, and contributed to a respectful and collaborative working culture aligned with UBS leadership principles and supervisory standards.
