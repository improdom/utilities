Although the final intended implementation was not executed due to performance limitations identified during testing, significant progress was achieved in understanding system constraints and informing strategic direction. I conducted POCs, performance analyses, and architectural evaluations that provided the evidence required for a leadership decision to pivot approach. These findings avoided further sunk cost and accelerated alignment toward a solution based on a more suitable platform. After the pivot, I transitioned into the new program, where the knowledge from this work is being applied to the next iteration of the platform strategy.
