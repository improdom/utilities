Hi <Manager Name>,

As discussed, I’ve put together the migration and rebranding plan for the existing Market Risk automation services that will be transitioned into the new CubIQ platform. The plan reflects the required DevOps restructuring, SPN setup, refactoring effort, and the expected deployment milestones.

  If this plan aligns with expectations, the next step will be to break it into GitLab epics and begin sequencing the technical work accordingly.

Please let me know if you'd like adjustments or additional detail before we finalize it.

Best regards,
Julio
