Throughout the year, I followed required operational controls and procedures and ensured that activities related to my role were executed in compliance with internal standards. I recorded and escalated issues appropriately when they occurred and completed required attestations, reviews, and operational tasks within expected timelines. I supported accountability by maintaining accurate documentation in the relevant systems and remained consistent in applying operational risk awareness in day-to-day work.
