Looking ahead, I see opportunities to further strengthen my impact by deepening my skills in data engineering, advanced analytics, and data science. As the CubIQ platform evolves, I want to continue building expertise in scalable data architectures, modern semantic modeling, and AI-driven development approaches. I am also interested in expanding my knowledge in cloud-native technologies, automation patterns, and machine learning tools that can support modernization and efficiency across the Market Risk ecosystem. By focusing on these areas, I aim to contribute more strategically to the evolving technology landscape and help drive innovation within the team.
