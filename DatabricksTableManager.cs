This year, I contributed to the SDM platform by delivering enhancements and solutions across multiple components while supporting the transition toward the new CubIQ model. I extended the MRV Builder to support more advanced and complex calculation logic and implemented an automated workflow for MRV creation, including validation and approvals to strengthen accuracy and governance. I also analyzed and improved DAX query performance, and those findings continue to inform and add value to the CubIQ semantic model now being developed with the Marvel team. In addition, I designed and implemented a reconciliation framework capable of validating data consistency across multiple layers of the platform, including MRVs, and this process will also be leveraged in the new CubIQ architecture. Through these contributions, I supported both ongoing SDM operations and the foundation for the next generation model.
