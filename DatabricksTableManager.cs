Throughout the year, I demonstrated collaboration, accountability, and continuous improvement in my day-to-day work. I partnered closely with colleagues across Market Risk—including the Marvel team, MROs, and the Transformation team—to align on shared goals, exchange knowledge, and ensure consistency across multiple components of the platform. I took ownership of my deliverables, communicated progress and risks transparently, and ensured work was completed to expected standards. I also contributed ideas and improvements, such as performance optimization approaches and automated workflows, reflecting a mindset of innovation and simplification.

Going forward, I will continue building on these behaviors by increasing cross-team engagement within the CubIQ program, sharing learnings earlier, and seeking feedback more proactively. As the platform evolves, I want to apply these behaviors in a way that supports faster learning loops, stronger alignment, and more scalable solutions.
