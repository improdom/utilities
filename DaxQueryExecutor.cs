I hope you're doing well.

Could you please assign Premium capacity to the following Power BI workspaces?

wsA

wsB

These workspaces require Premium features to support advanced semantic model deployment scenarios, including models configured with DefaultPowerBIDataSourceVersion = PowerBI_V3.

Additionally, assigning Premium capacity will enable the Large dataset storage format, which is essential for our models due to their size and complexity. This will allow us to take advantage of key features such as:

Support for datasets larger than 1 GB

XMLA read/write endpoints

Incremental refresh

Enhanced metadata

Hybrid tables

Please let me know if you need any further information.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
Julio Diaz
