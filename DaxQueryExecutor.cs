Yes, we are still following a RISK process for updating MRV definitions based on user inputs. This is a sub-process designed to validate and reconcile the definitions safely. Currently, new MRVs are created in a separate staging model, and we only promote the definitions to the main model after they’ve been verified as correct and stable.

At the moment, this staging model is completely decoupled from the main model, which contains important risk data. If an MRV is problematic, we can isolate and correct it without any impact on the main model.

I’ll schedule a meeting on Monday to walk through these changes in detail.

Thanks,
