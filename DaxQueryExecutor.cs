**Subject:** RE: ARC-PBI Strategic Data Model

Hi Venkat K,

The file provided by Ankush contains the complete log file, which my script is currently unable to parse. Amar mentioned that you had loaded the logs into a table—would it be possible to extract only the DAX queries from there? That way, I can parse them and generate the list of attributes.

Thanks,
Julio Díaz

Let me know if you want the tone to be more formal or more casual, or if you want to add a follow-up or clarification.
