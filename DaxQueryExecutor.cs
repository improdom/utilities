Hi Pravat,

I want to personally thank you for supporting and implementing the recent changes. These adjustments are critical, and I’d like to give you some background so you have the full context.

Last year, we had already planned these improvements as part of CDM. However, Sindhu and Venkata V. proposed eliminating the PBI ETL process and working directly off the source tables. At the time, we explained that data preparation was absolutely necessary in the BI world and highlighted the risks of bypassing it. Unfortunately, their approach was imposed, which increased data volumes, created ongoing performance issues, and left us with a heavier, less stable model.

The work you are doing now is reversing those impacts and restoring the solid foundation we originally intended. By re-establishing the preparation layer, you’re not only fixing the immediate issues but also enabling the optimizations that had been planned all along.

I truly appreciate your efforts — you’re helping to bring stability back and put us in a strong position to move forward.

Thanks,
Julio Díaz
