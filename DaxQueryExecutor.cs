**Subject:** RE: MRV Definitions and Reconciliation Status Update Process

Hi John/Shilpa,

The statuses we’re currently using are inconsistent and don’t clearly reflect the individual steps in the reconciliation workflow. To improve clarity and alignment across teams, I’ve proposed the following updated set of statuses to accurately represent each stage of the process.

Please review and share your thoughts so we can finalize and update accordingly.

| **Status**               | **Description**                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `METADATA_COPIED`        | Metadata copied from the on-prem system to the staging environment.          |
| `MRV_CREATED_STAGING`    | MRV measures created in the Power BI staging model.                          |
| `RECONCILIATION_PENDING` | Awaiting execution of reconciliation to verify the accuracy of the measures. |
| `RECONCILED`             | Reconciliation completed successfully; measures passed automated checks.     |
| `APPROVAL_PENDING`       | Awaiting manual review and approval by the user.                             |
| `APPROVED`               | User has manually verified and approved the measures.                        |
| `METADATA_PUBLISHED`     | Approved metadata has been copied to the main environment.                   |
| `MRV_CREATED_MAIN`       | Final MRV measures created in the main Power BI model.                       |
| `COMPLETED`              | Entire process completed successfully.                                       |
