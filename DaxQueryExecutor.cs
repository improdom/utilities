Hi [Manager's Name],

Following our meeting earlier today, I wanted to summarize and confirm our agreement regarding the implementation of a readiness event for the Trend Data Retention Service.

We agreed to introduce a new event in the Event Hub—tentatively named ARC_PBI_QUERY_SPACE_READY—which will be raised by the retention service once all queries within a given query space have been successfully completed. When this occurs, the query space is considered to be in a Ready state.

Clients subscribed to this service will listen for this event to determine when it's safe to proceed with their downstream processes, such as refreshing Trend reports. The event will include the following required fields:

querySpaceName

businessDate

Optionally, the event can include metadata like source system name, creation timestamps, and system tags, depending on client needs.

This new event structure enhances clarity and coordination between systems, ensuring clients can reliably trigger actions based on query readiness.

Please let me know if you’d like me to proceed with documenting the schema or initiating development tasks.

Best regards,
Julio Diaz
