Subject: RE: ARC-PBI Strategic Data Model

Hi Sridhar,

I‚Äôve pushed the changes to filter SDC dimensions by CobDate to the following branch:

Notes
	‚Ä¢	Modifications were made to the default partitions in the model, aligning them with the in-memory table refresh logic.
	‚Ä¢	A new partition will be created and used for each CobDate.
	‚Ä¢	Perge Service needs to be updated to retain partitions for the last two CobDates.
	‚Ä¢	Consistency is required across all tables for CobDate fields (key name, type, etc.).

View Name	Column	Type
pbi_dim_instrument_vw	business_date	DateTime
pbi_dim_issuer_vw	business_date	DateTime
pbi_dim_le_hierarchy_vw	business_date	DateTime
pbi_fact_ms_bucket_group_map_vw	cob_date	Integer
pbi_fact_issuer_adv_vw	cob_date	Integer
pbi_fact_bucketink_weight_vw	cob_date	Integer
pbi_dim_book_hierarchy_vw	business_date	DateTime

‚ö†Ô∏è In the default partition M query, a dead condition was added to prevent materialization, using it as a template only.

I used this copy of the model to test the changes: ARCModel_Refresh

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
