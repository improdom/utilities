Got it — here’s a softer version of the email with “confirm” replaced by more subtle wording:

**Subject:** Follow-up on Node Migration Request

Hi Zack,

I wanted to follow up on the earlier request regarding the second node. As you mentioned, the first node was successfully moved to a new cluster and we observed improved performance as a result.

Could you let us know if it would be possible for the second node to also be migrated to a similar cluster to achieve the same level of improvements?

Thank you for your guidance on this.

Best regards,
Julio

Would you like me to make it **even more neutral** (e.g., phrased as an open-ended question) or keep this slight hint toward feasibility?
