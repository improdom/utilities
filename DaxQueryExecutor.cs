Hi all,

As discussed, the MRV metadata is now available in the Marvel database in SQL MI, under the CubIQ schema.

Since this is a shared/common database, there is no longer a need for a separate API to serve this data. Attached is a SQL query that produces a dataset equivalent to what was previously exposed via the metadata API.

If you have the required access, please convert the attached query into a SQL view to simplify and standardize consumption.

Thanks,  
Julio Diaz
