Hi Anup,

As discussed, could you please confirm which SPN we should use for CubIQ services and Power BI?

Specifically, we would like to confirm whether we should use:

- SVC_DEV_AT40482_MARVEL_POWERBI, or  
- SVC_DEV_AT40482_MARVEL_CUBIQ

From the email thread below, it appears that the recommendation is to reuse the existing Marvel account for CubIQ. I just want to make sure we have an explicit confirmation before proceeding.

Thanks in advance for your confirmation.

Regards,  
Julio Diaz
