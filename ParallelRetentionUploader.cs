Hi all,

Model development is now complete. The pending items listed in the previous email have been resolved, including MRVs.

In DEV, we’re observing strong performance — queries are completing within seconds in Databricks, which aligns with our objective. These changes have now been sent to QA, and data loading is in progress.

Some table optimizations have already been applied in DEV and will also be applied in QA. This will remain a continuous process, with further tuning identified and implemented as needed.

Best regards,
Julio Diaz
