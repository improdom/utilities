You are right to be worried, and you're asking the question at exactly the right moment — when the table is still “only” 7 billion rows and not 8 × that.

Let’s map the danger, then map the defenses.

First, let me restate the situation to be sure we're aligned:

Power BI is DirectQuery (DQ) into Databricks.

The detail table currently has ~7B rows for a single cob_date_id (close of business date).

Table is physically partitioned by (cob_date_id, measure_id).

Queries today are fast enough.

Soon you'll have ~8 cob dates loaded, which means ~56B+ rows in that same table.

You want performance to stay consistent, not fall off a cliff as history accumulates.

That’s a classic “works in POC, falls apart in prod” trap. Let's keep you out of it.

We’ll go layer by layer: storage layout, query patterns, and semantic model behavior.

Storage layout: how the table is organized on disk
Right now you’re partitioned by cob_date_id and measure_id.

Why that helps:

Most reports filter by a date range and by measure_id, so the engine can skip entire partitions instead of scanning the entire table.

With just one cob_date, partition pruning (skipping irrelevant partitions) is basically perfect.

Why this will get worse with more COBs:

When you add 8 different cob_date_ids, a query that doesn’t explicitly filter cob_date_id will now touch 8× more partitions.

Some “compare today vs previous COB” visuals will ask for 2+ cob_date_ids at once on the same visual. That's already multiplicative cost.

From experience: users always end up asking trend-over-time, not just “today.”

How to keep that from exploding:
A. Enforce date filters from Power BI
Make sure every DQ query sent by Power BI always filters cob_date_id (or a surrogate like calendar_date). You want no report that can query “all time.”
That means:

Add row-level security–style filters in the model that always inject a cob_date window (like last N days).

Or inject “current COB only” logic using a measure or table relationship trick similar to your REFRESH_CONTROL pattern: the model only exposes a “Current COB” table with 1 row, and all visuals are filtered through it unless explicitly overridden.

This stops accidental full-history scans.

B. Consider time-based retention in the live DQ table
Keep only the last N COBs (maybe 5–10 days) in the “hot” DirectQuery detail table, and move older COBs to a colder table that’s not wired to the default report path.
In plain terms: don’t let users aim a default visual at 2 months of raw detail unless they’re in a special “historical view” report that you can tune separately.

This is a policy decision, not just an engineering trick. But it works. You get predictable scan volume.

C. Use liquid clustering / Z-Ordering (adaptive clustering by columns you filter on most)
Partitioning is coarse. Clustering is fine-grained ordering inside each partition so reads stay local.

You’ve got partitions on (cob_date_id, measure_id). That’s good, but inside each partition the data might be spread randomly. When Power BI says “give me measure_id = 42,” Databricks may still have to open too many files.

Solution: apply liquid clustering (or Z-Ordering if you’re not yet using liquid) by [measure_id, some_other_filter_key_like_portfolio_or_desk] inside each partition.

Mechanically what this does: it keeps rows that tend to be filtered together in the same file ranges. So even when the table grows to 56B rows, any one query ideally needs only a few files, not thousands.

This keeps performance closer to “constant-time per query pattern” instead of “linear in table growth.”

Query patterns from Power BI: what DQ is actually asking Databricks for
Power BI DirectQuery with visuals is sneaky. It doesn’t always send the filter you think. For example, DISTINCT lists in slicers (dropdown filters in the report) often ask Databricks things like:

“Give me all unique [Book / Desk / Product] for the last X COBs.”

That’s basically a group by across a giant slice of the table.

Those DISTINCT queries get nastier as data grows,
especially on:

high-cardinality columns (like trade_id, position_id, etc.)

non-integer join keys

very wide rows

Here’s what you can do:

A. Push high-cardinality attributes out of the detail table and into narrow dimension tables
You’ve already been doing this thinking for aggregation tables and satellite dimensions. Keep going.

Rule of thumb: The detail fact table should carry:

numeric facts (report_value, etc.)

join keys (int/bigint surrogate keys)

the absolute minimum set of context columns needed to filter (desk_id, book_id, etc.), and they should be integer keys, not long strings.

Every descriptive / verbose / text column that users slice on should live in a dimension table that Power BI can query separately (and that table should be a lot smaller than billions of rows).

Why this helps:
When a slicer needs “all distinct books,” Power BI can hit the dimension (maybe tens of thousands of rows) instead of SELECT DISTINCT book FROM 56B-row fact.

That one change alone can be the difference between sub-second and meltdown.

B. Force integer surrogate keys everywhere
If any join is still using string business keys or decimal(38,0), fix that. Text joins → expensive shuffles. High-precision decimals can also be heavier than INT/BIGINT in Spark’s join planner. Integer surrogate keys (like book_id INT, cob_date_id INT, etc.) allow:

faster hash joins

better clustering/sorting behavior

better compression

Spark loves int keys. Feed Spark what it loves.

C. Pre-calculate popular aggregates into import-mode tables in Power BI
This is your “aggregation table” story. You already have one import table that Power BI can hit instead of querying the huge DirectQuery detail unless the visual asks for very granular drillthrough.

This must evolve as volume grows:

Add more targeted aggregation tables for “top 90% use cases.”

Make sure relationship mappings in Power BI are correctly set so that visuals hit Import first and only fall back to DirectQuery detail when absolutely necessary.

This is basically building highways for common queries so DirectQuery only handles the back roads.

Concurrency and capacity: what happens when 5–20 people click at once
Right now in dev, probably nobody else is clicking.

In prod, several people will run slightly different COB comparisons at once. That means Databricks will have concurrent queries all targeting overlapping but not identical data.

You can prepare for that:

A. Size / configure the SQL Warehouse for concurrency, not just for single-query speed
Make sure your Databricks SQL Warehouse (or whatever endpoint Power BI is hitting) is sized to handle multiple parallel queries with enough cluster resources (cores/memory) so it doesn’t start queueing work. Under-sized warehouses look fine during POC, then collapse in production when two PMs open the dashboard at the same time.

B. Cache hot results
Databricks SQL can cache the results of repeated queries in memory. When most users open the same “morning dashboard,” you want most visuals to hit cache, not recompute over 56B rows. This is boring, unglamorous, and incredibly effective.

C. Pre-warm critical visuals
Generate the core dashboard queries (for “current COB” and maybe “current vs previous COB”) on a schedule and let that sit hot in the cache. That way the first human user of the morning doesn’t pay the cold start.

Bringing it all together
Let's boil this into a playbook you can take to architecture review:

Keep partition pruning effective
Every Power BI report should include cob_date_id filters (current COB or last N COBs). Block “all history” queries by default.

Limit hot history in the main detail table
Store only recent COBs in the live DirectQuery path. Archive older COBs to a different table that is not hit by default visuals.

Improve physical layout
Use liquid clustering / Z-Order on columns you filter by most (measure_id, desk/book/etc.) so scans stay local as data grows.

Slim the fact table
Fact = numeric measures + int keys only. Move descriptive columns and high-cardinality attributes to dimension tables. This avoids DISTINCT/group-by scans on billions of rows.

Expand Import-mode aggregations
Add more summarized Import tables in Power BI for the common rollups. Let DirectQuery touch the monster table only for rare “deep drill.”

Enforce integer surrogate keys for joins
No string joins. No weird decimals. INT/BIGINT keys wherever possible for joins and relationships.

Engineer for concurrency, not just single-query latency
Right-size the SQL Warehouse for parallel load. Pre-warm/cache the most common queries so first user doesn’t take the hit.

Why this works: none of these items depend on luck or “maybe Spark is fast enough.” They’re structural. They scale linearly in users and data instead of exponentially in pain.

Natural next step is: we can sketch how to split the current detail table into (1) the lean “query path” table that stays hot in DirectQuery and (2) a colder historical store + dimension tables. This makes performance predictable instead of fragile.
