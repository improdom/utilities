Hi Farhan/Siva,

As a short-term tactical measure, I recommend upgrading to version 2.1.4 to obtain the additional six months of coverage while we work on a permanent solution.

The long-term solution would involve developing a custom implementation. This will require some time, as full regression testing will be necessary before promoting it to production.

Upgrading now gives us the required buffer to properly plan, implement, and validate the final solution in a controlled manner.
