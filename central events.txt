Centralized Management:

Simplifies the configuration and management of event hubs.
Centralized monitoring and logging of events can help in easier debugging and performance tuning.
Consistent security policies and access control can be enforced.
Decoupling and Scalability:

A central component can handle the routing and transformation of events, enabling better decoupling between microservices.
Microservices can scale independently as they only need to connect to the central component instead of multiple endpoints.
Consistency:

Ensures a uniform approach to event handling, reducing the chances of discrepancies and integration issues.
Standardizes the event schema and processing logic across different teams.
Reduced Redundancy:

Avoids duplicating the logic for publishing and consuming events in multiple microservices, leading to reduced code duplication.
