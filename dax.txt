Hi Sai,

Regarding data volume size, providing the raw numbers alone may not be helpful since we donâ€™t have a comparable model. The new model has fewer tables and columns, making it difficult to directly compare its size to the current model. We need a structured approach to measure and evaluate these numbers effectively.

Additionally, the total size of the data loaded into memory is the sum of all dimension tables and the aggregation table.

Thanks,
